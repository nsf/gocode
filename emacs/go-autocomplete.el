;; Ensure that go-autocomplete in your load-path and add to your ~/.emacs
;; following line:
;;
;; (require 'go-autocomplete)

;; Also you could setup any combination (for example M-TAB)
;; for invoking auto-complete:
;;
;; (require 'auto-complete-config)
;; (define-key ac-mode-map (kbd "M-TAB") 'auto-complete)
